# Homework 14 (actually, it's 13...)

It was easy to get along with the first part of it by just following along with the notes from class. With deploying the different tokenizer forms it became a bit more difficult, making me realize that I might not have yet fully grasped what's going on. Maybe it would be good to find some explanatory readings.

## Questions ##
* Is there a way to tell in advance whether to use Porter Stemmer?
* When to use `use_idf=False` vs `use_idf=True`? In some tasks it didn't seem to make a difference, in others it did. Is there way to tell other than shotgun trying?
