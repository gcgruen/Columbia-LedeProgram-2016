# Homework 11

* Had to work with a mini-violations.csv, because my computer would overheat even with the suggested small-violations.csv version

* I think it would be great to have a separate session on what different ways there are to deal with NaN, NoneType errors/values

* In summary, this one was very challenging. But I like that, because I think by struggeling with something, you really remember it better and conceptually understand bits and pieces because you end up spending hours with them.
