## Homework5
### Spotify
Took me ages to figure out the answer to the genre-count question and I wish I came up with the solution Mercy figured, without using Counter.
Also TAs, at some point I have two answers for the same question (number 6), because first I did it by copy pasting the code I wrote and just altering the artist's name and felt that there must be an easier way. Soma then explained in Lab how to write functions, so I rewrote my code using a function. I left my initial coded answer in, for my own reference -- you can just ignore the first answer, if you like (also left comments on this along the notebook)

### New York Times
This one was really difficult, especially towards the end. Luckily, finally it worked out nonetheless.
Also found that it is useful to write down (in words, not code) a breakdown of the single steps needed to get the answer.

Would also recommend, if you re-do this homework in future classes, let people know about the old API documentation! As with the new one you don't really find anything (the base URI is basically hidden like an easter egg...) and once you have discovered the readme vs documentation for each API, you'll find yourself jumping back and forth. Which we don't like, because we are lazy programmers ;)
And on the old version, information is much better organized and accessible.

### Lil' Graphics
Nice to do something non-python-y ;)
How I proceeded:
1) Copy results into atom, make it a csv with "name, score"
2) Import into Excel and convert into xls
3) Sort by popularity
4) Define values for bar chart
5) Optimize layout of the chart

The final chart I uploaded both, as a jpg file as well as within the xls file.

### Search Engine
Great to work in atom again, to get back to the roots and be reminded of the twists & tweaks necessary here. Somehow I like working in atom more than iPython-notebook, I have to say.
This was a REALLY challenging task. But I like challenges a lot!
Also I think it's basically a lot of repetition but helps understanding the effects of nesting even better.
