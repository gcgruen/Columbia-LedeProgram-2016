## Homework7

This is a lot of fun, I like that we are getting closer to real life.
However, so far I think a few things would be done more easily in Excel or Google Spreadsheet than with pandas (adding colums, applying calculations on it), because that whole where-to-put-brackets-dilemma doesn't happen in Excel that much.

In contrast I think pandas has advantages over excel when it comes to graphics.
