## Prep work

Go through each column in your data set and answer the following questions:

1. Is it ordinal, nominal, or quantitative?

name -- nominal
animal -- nominal
favorite_food -- nominal
age -- quantitative, discrete (at least the way we count it)
lbs -- quantitative, continuous
times_arrested -- quantitative, continuous

2. What are 4 planar or visual variables I could use to describe these columns? (e.g. position)

name -- position
animal -- color
favorite_food -- color
age -- size/ line length
lbs -- shape/circle
times_arrested -- orientation

3. If I wanted to aggregate the data, would it make sense to...
- Count how many of each value are inside?
Yes
- Get an average?
Yes
- Add up the numbers to create a total?
No.

4. If it's a quantitative column, give an example of how you could change it into an ordinal column.
Group some ages/weights/times_arrested together, i.e. to
- age: young (0-4), adult(5-15)
- weight: light, normal weight, heavy
- times_arrested: morning, afternoon, night
