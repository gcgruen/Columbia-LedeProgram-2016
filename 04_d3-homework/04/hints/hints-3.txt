THE PIE GENERATOR: Every wedge in the pie gets the same width, so even though you use the pie generator, you're going to set value to always be 1/12 - that way each slice takes up 1/12th of the entire pie.
























SETUP: WHen you make a pie, it's good practice to do add .sort(null) onto your pie to keep it from resorting your data (unless you want it to).

  var pie = d3.pie()
    .sort(null)



















DIFFERENT SIZED ARCS: How do you set the size of an arc? We've always set this value to be the same for every arc, but now we need to change it based on the high temperature (you'll need a scale).

























COLORS: The colors look fancy, but honestly it's just a scaleLinear going from blue to pink. Pick for yourself what looks best as the value that becomes blue and the value that becomes pink.


















CENTERING: if the height is 100 and the width is 200, what's the center? If height and width are variables, can you express that mathematically?



















SETUP: WHen you make a pie, it's good practice to do add .sort(null) onto your pie to keep it from resorting your data.

  var pie = d3.pie()
    .sort(null)

























THE CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE: What's the x/y for the middle if you've already moved a g element? I used #666666 for the color of mine, and 2 for the radius.





















THE TEXT: How many do you need? Many text elements, or just one? Since it's just one, how do you add it?
























THE TEXT: .attr("font-weight", "600") will make your font bold, and .attr("text-anchor", "middle") will center your text
