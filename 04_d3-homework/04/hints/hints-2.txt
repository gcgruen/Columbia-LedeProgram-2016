It's almost the same thing as chart 1!!!


























POSITIONING: You need to evenly space out the pies like you'd evenly space out circles. What kind of scale do you use for that?

























ELEMENTS: You need 4 pie charts, but you have 12 data points. How do you group them together?

























ELEMENTS, PART TWO: Each pie needs to be grouped together in its own element that you can move around. What is that element? How do you move it around if it doesn't have an x and a y?

























PIES THEMSELVES: Once you've made the group objects, you can use .each on them to draw inside of them. Access the g element itself by using d3.select(this) - this allows you to put things inside of it, just like the svg etc.

























DATA: If you have too many wedges, it's because you bound datapoints instead of the nested data! Take a look at d in your .each() function to see how you can access just the data for that particular group.


























LABELS: You add MANY paths for each group, so you use selectAll. But you're only adding ONE text element, so you shoud just use .append. If you don't know where the name of the project comes from, take a look at your d.
