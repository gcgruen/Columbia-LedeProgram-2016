d3.line needed x and y
d3.area needed x, y0 and y1 (kind of)
d3.radialLine needed radius and angle
d3.radialArea needs.... go look it up, and think about how arcs are made https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#radialArea 


























DOUBLE HINT: You're going to need an angleScale and a radiusScale. What determines the angle? What determines the radius?















SPACE IN THE MIDDLE FOR "NYC": Pay attention to your innerRadius.




















CENTERING: We talked about this already! Position the g in the center using some height/width math + translate/transform.




















THOSE CIRCLES: You can create datasets that aren't the datasets you're importing. I made an array of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] to bind and create those circles.
























THOSE TEXTS: You can create datasets that aren't the datasets you're importing. I made another data array just like the circles one to bind and create the text elements.





















MAKING DEC MATCH UP WITH JAN: you probably have an issue with the december -> january connecting being weird, right? Well what if january wasn't just the first month, but also the last month..? that way you'd have
JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEPT OCT NOV DEC JAN
and everything would be perfect! if you try and can't get it, scroll down for another hint.

























MAKING DEC MATCH UP WITH JAN, P2: To make january be the first AND the last element of the list, use datapoints.push(datapoints[0]);
