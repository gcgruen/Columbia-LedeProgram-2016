SETUP: It's another small multiples! This means multiple g elements, transform/translate and an .each to loop through
























SETUP: WHen you make a pie, it's good practice to do add .sort(null) onto your pie to keep it from resorting your data (unless you want it to).

  var pie = d3.pie()
    .sort(null)


















DRAWING: And of course that means d3.select(this) inside of the each to gain access to the g element you're going to be putting things inside of.























DATA: And of course examine 'd' inside of the each statement to remind yourself where your city name is and where your data elements actually are.






























FITTING THEM IN, PART ONE: You'll want to make the radius smaller!


























FITTING THEM IN, PART 2: The kind of scale you use to space everything out is going to run your circles off of the page. You can also add a padding(0) to the scale to add padding near the elements on the edges - padding can be from 0 to 1, so experiment with the values that look the best.




























TEXT LABELS: Even though you need a label for every country, because you have the nested/g thing going you can just do an .append and it will give you one for each g element.
