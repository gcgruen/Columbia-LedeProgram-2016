## Assignment 1: Results of Statistical Analysis
**mean**: 6 days 15:05:05 -- on average each complaint was open for six days and approx. 15 hours, that seems pretty long!

**median**: 0 days 21:48:15 -- the median shows a very different image (that seems more reasonable), suggesting that open time of complaints cluster around 21 hours and 48 minutes

**range**: 108 days 09:25:00 -- the wide range of more than 108 days of open time supports what the big difference between mean and median already suggested: the data varies widely

**standard deviation**: 14 days 12:05:38 -- this further supports the above mentioned point of the data ranging widely. On average, the values are 14 days and 12 hours away from the mean; proving that the median is a better measure in this case.

**quantile 1**: 0 days 01:14:00 -- 25% or a quarter of all complaints filed are closed within 1 hour and 14 minutes

**quantile 2** = median: see above -- 50% or half of all complaints filed are closed within 21 hours and 48 minutes

**quantile 3**: 4 days 00:30:48 -- 75% or two thirds of all complaints filed are closed within 4 days and 30 minutes.

**interquantile range**: 3 days 23:16:48

**outliers**:
*upper acceptance limit*: 9 days 23:26:01 -- if open time of a complaint filed is longer than 9 days and 23 hours and 26 minutes, then the data record is most likely an outlier

*lower acceptance limit*: - 6 days +02:18:47 -- if open time of a complaint filed is shorter than minus six days and two hours it's likely to be an outlier. However, ignoring statistics, anything that is below 0 days and 0minutes is an outlier, as that would equal closing a complaint before it even existed (would be a marvellous job by NYPD...)

## Assignment 2:
The correlation coefficient of 0.88 suggests a strong linear correlation between the two variables median income and recycling rate -- the wealthier a community is on average the more likely it is to also recycle. The scatter plot underlines this correlation.

This sounds reasonable, given the fact that with a low income you might have other worries than recycling...

However, external factors could also be at play. To consider that one would need to take a look at what "recycling rate" actually means and what it is determined by. For example, it could also be the case that in the districts with a lower income get fewer recycling bins from the city government than "richer" districts get.

## Assignment 3:
Correlation coefficient (men): 0.86
Correlation coefficient (women): 0.85

The correlation between height and weight for women is slightly smaller than the one for men. Also graphs look similar, only with the one for men (blue colored dots) being generally taller and heavier than women (red colored dots) (see non-beautified graphic below).

Within each group, the weight-range is comparatively wide at the middle of the height-scale -- for both groups.
