#Make a list of the following numbers: 22, 90, 0, -10, 3, 22, and 48
numbers = [22, 90, 0, -10, 3, 22, 48]

# 0)Display the number of elements in the list
print(len(numbers))

# 1) Display the 4th element of this list.
print(numbers[3])

# 2) Display the sum of the 2nd and 4th element of the list.
print(numbers[1]+numbers[3])

# 3) Display the 2nd-largest value in the list.
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
#print(sorted(numbers))
print(sorted_numbers[5])

# 4) Display the last element of the original unsorted list
print(numbers[6])

# 5) For each number, display a number:
#if your original number is less than 10, multiply it by thirty
#If it's also even, add six.
#If it's greater than 50 subtract ten.
#If it's not negative ten, subtract one.

# fifth approach - tracing backwards.
for number in numbers:
    if number > 50:
        if number != -10:
            print (int(number) - 10 - 1 )
        else:
            print (int(number) - 10 )
    elif number < 10:
        if number % 2 == 0 and number != -10:
            print (int(number) * 30 + 6 - 1 )
        elif number % 2 == 0:
            print (int(number) * 30 + 6 )
        elif number != -10:
            print (int(number) * 30 - 1 )
        else:
            print (int(number) * 30 )
    else:
        print (int(number) - 1 )

# 6) Sum the result of each of the numbers divided by two.
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8244915/how-do-you-divide-each-element-in-a-list-by-an-int
myInt = 2
divided_numbers_list = [number / myInt for number in numbers]

print(sum(divided_numbers_list))

#7) Sometimes dictionaries are used to describe multiple aspects of a single object.
# Like, say, a movie. Define a dictionary called movie that works
#with the following code.
#print "My favorite movie is", movie['title'], "which was released in", movie['year'], "and was directed by", movie['director']
movie = {'title': "Inception", 'year': 2010, 'director': "Christopher Nolan"}
print ("My favorite movie is", movie['title'], "which was released in", movie['year'], "and was directed by", movie['director'])
#8) Add entries to the movie dictionary for budget and revenue (you'll use
#code like movie['budget'] = 1000), and print out the difference between the two.
movie = {'title': "Inception", 'year': 2010, 'director': "Christopher Nolan", 'budget': 160, 'revenue': 825 }
difference = movie['revenue'] - movie['budget']
print("The difference between revenue and budget was", difference, "million")
#9) If the movie cost more to make than it made in theaters,
#print "It was a flop". If the film's revenue was more than five times the
#amount it cost to make, print "That was a good investment."
if difference > 0:
    print ("That was a good investment.")
else:
    print ("It was a flop.")

#10) Sometimes dictionaries are used to describe the same aspects of many
#different objects. Make ONE dictionary that describes the population of
#the boroughs of NYC. Manhattan has 1.6 million residents, Brooklyn has 2.6m,
#Bronx has 1.4m, Queens has 2.3m and Staten Island has 470,000.
#(Tip: keeping it all in either millions or thousands is a good idea)

population_nyc = {'Manhattan': 1.6, 'Brooklyn': 2.6, 'Bronx': 1.4, 'Queens': 2.3, 'Staten Island': 0.47}

#12) Display the population of Brooklyn.
print("The population of Brooklyn is", population_nyc['Brooklyn'], "million.")

#13) Display the combined population of all five boroughs.
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4880960/sum-of-all-values-in-a-python-dict
total = sum(population_nyc.values())
print("The total population in all five boroughs of New York City is", total, "million.")

#14) Display what percent of NYC's population lives in Manhattan.
Manhattan_share = population_nyc['Manhattan']/ int(total) * 100
print("Approximately", Manhattan_share, "percent of people in NYC live in Manhattan.")
